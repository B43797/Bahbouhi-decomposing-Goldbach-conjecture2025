# Goldbach + Factorization Tool

This website allows users to enter any even number E ≥ 4 and decompose it as E = p + q, with p and q both primes (Goldbach’s strong conjecture).

It then uses this decomposition to help **factor nearby odd numbers** by exploiting the structure:  
E = 2ⁿ × O ⇒ O = E / 2ⁿ

## 🚀 How to use it
1. Go to the site: [https://your-site.github.io](https://your-site.github.io)  
2. Type any even number like 100, 10⁶, 10¹⁸ or higher
3. The system returns a valid (p, q) Goldbach pair
4. It also helps factor the odd number O = E / 2ⁿ

## 📈 Features
- Handles very large numbers (tested up to 10¹⁸ in < 1 second)
- Based on Bahbouhi’s Hybrid GPS Algorithm and prime tracks
- Works entirely in your browser (client-side, no server)

## 🧠 Mathematical idea

Any even E = 2ⁿ × O  
→ If we know E = p + q with both primes, then it may help factor O indirectly.
